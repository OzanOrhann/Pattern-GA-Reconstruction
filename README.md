##Pattern-Based Image Reconstruction with Genetic Algorithms

This project demonstrates image reconstruction using Genetic Algorithms (GA).
The algorithm attempts to reconstruct or approximate target images by evolving a population of candidate patterns through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.

##Project Overview
-Uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimization.
-Individuals represent pixel patterns.
-Fitness is evaluated based on similarity to the target image.
-Iterative evolution improves the quality of reconstructed images.
